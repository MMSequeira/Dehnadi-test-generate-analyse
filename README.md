#A tool for generating Dehnadi tests, and analysing test responses

I occasionally am asked to help people who want to repeat Saeed Dehnadi's test experiments. I'm a little reluctant in general, because of my reservations about the test (see my online retraction of the "_Camels and Humps_" claims). But I did build a tool which can generate versions of his test, with question text selected by the user. This is that tool.
