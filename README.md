#A tool for generating Dehnadi tests, and analysing test responses

I occasionally am asked to help people who want to repeat Saeed Dehnadi's test experiments. I'm a little reluctant in general, because of my reservations about the claims that have been made about the test and his results (see my [online retraction](http://www.eis.mdx.ac.uk/staffpages/r_bornat/papers/camel_hump_retraction.pdf) of the "_Camels and Humps_" claims that I made). But I did build a tool which can generate versions of his test, with question text selected by the user. This is that tool.

See the build directory for instructions to compile and build using ant. Without ant, you are on your own: it can be done in Eclipse but I'm not giving details.
